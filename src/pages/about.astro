        I am a Software Dude, currently working as a DevOps Engineer for <a href="https://www.canopytax.com">Canopy</a>.
        I like to talk about Python, containers, and DevOps things such as Microservices and Continuous Delivery.

      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
        I was always interested in Software. I wrote my first program in BASIC when I was 14, and a Tic-tac-toe AI
        in Python when I was 17. I then moved on to get my degree in Computer Science at Brigham Young University.
        After graduating, I worked for Amazon, or more specifically, AWS. Eventually, one of my college buddies
        pulled me back into Utah to work for a startup Canopy. Canopy is now where I reside focusing on microservices
        and rapid development.
